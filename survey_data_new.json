The data collected in this version of the survey will be used to support two working groups. The Call Processing working group will use this data to support the development of their stadnards. The Staffing Guidelines working group will use this data to have the data to start creating a new staffing guidelines recommendation. Due to the number of questions that were suggested between the working groups, the overall process has been split into several surveys to make them easier and quicker to complete. Each survey is intended to take about 15 to 20 minutes to complete. At the bottom of the page, you will find a session ID. You can use this to access the individual surveys and tie the results together to build individual profiles for a center while preserving anonymity. ",
